</h1>
<h3>
    Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS.
     Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. 
    Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality.

    Microsoft has released most of Visual Studio Code's source code on the microsoft/vscode repository of GitHub using the "Code â€“ OSS"
     name, under the permissive MIT License, while the releases by Microsoft are proprietary freeware.
